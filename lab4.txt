#	Purpose:  
#	For this lab, you are going to create a Risk Estimator program that will ask
#	a series of yes/no questions and, then, print a percentage to the screen.
#	Each question is worth a predetermined number of points. If the user
#	specifies the correct answer, it is added to their total score.
#	From this, you can compute a Risk Estimate from the answers. 
#	Risk Estimate= Points Earned / Total Points
